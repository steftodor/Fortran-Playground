# Projects in Fortran 

Not sure why but [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMWzgy8FsKs) video made me want to try fortran out.

## Prerequisites 
Install [GNU Fortran Compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/) on MacOS `brew install gcc`

## Running the programs 
 1. Compile using `gfortran [application]`
 2. Run using `./a.out`

## Example

# Current "Programs"

fibonacci - stores the first 30 numbers in the fibonacci sequence in an array, then prints them
helloWorld - prints hello world
